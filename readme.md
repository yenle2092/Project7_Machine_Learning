# Project 4: ML

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to practise in supervised learning using provided data. We need to create the model for the prediction/classification. Each group will need to research and implement the defined supervised machine learning methods.

### Plan of work

Please perform EDA and data cleaning.

Please conduct EDA and descriptive analytics

As soon as your dataset is ready, please start the research about your models. Please note, that each group member should research at least 1 model.
BaggingClassifier
MultinomialNB
Stacking
RidgeClassifier

Feature selection (if needed)

Implement your models on your data

Do not forget about Hyperparameters tuning

Compare the results using metrics:

accuracy
recall
precision
ROC_AUC score
plot ROC_AUC curve
